# Use the official Node.js version 20 image as the base.
# This pulls a full Debian-based image (roughly 1 GB) that includes
# compilers, curl, git, apt, and hundreds of other tools.
# Those tools are useful for building software but dangerous
# to leave in a production image.

WORKDIR /app

# Copy everything from the current directory on your machine
# into /app inside the container.
# This includes app.js and package.json -- but also .env,
# any private keys, and everything else in the folder.

# Install Node.js dependencies inside the container.
